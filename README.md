This was an interesting one for me - I found the code easier to write thank the math game, however I can see that the user experience isn't that great.  I'm leaving it as is in order to move forward but I will probably come back and revisit this when I have mre time.
Thank you for looking at this I'm looking foward to all criticism on how to improve.
